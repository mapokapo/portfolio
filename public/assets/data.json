      "content": "My first encounter with software development was at 13 years old.<br /><br />In 2016, by recommendation of my maths teacher, I signed up for an annual children's robotics tournament, organized by SPARK - a local programming academy. My team and I had a surprising success in the tournament and we ended up winning first place and keeping the title for 3 years in a row!<br /><br />This success sparked a new interest in programming. I enrolled into the SPARK academy soon after, which I successfully graduated. I ended up being the youngest person to ever attend that course in history. I learned what programming is, and how to make my first website. It was the starting point of my career.",

As I found out, practicing programming at home in your free time really pays off. Eventually, I had to decide which area to specialize in: frontend, backend, mobile... It was hard to decide, so I naturally tried everything.<br /><br />I finished the advanced programming course in SPARK, went through a few more tournaments, and even held lectures to my peers. Nowadays I consider myself a full stack developer, capable of making web, desktop, and mobile applications, as well as backend servers, CLI tools, and games in multiple languages. It wasn't all easy sailing though - I was going to a demanding high school at the same time which caused me a lot of stress.<br /><br />Still, I managed to confirm my success by winning more tournaments through my school.",

I was still very cautious when looking for jobs or education opportunities, because I was unsure what I was getting myself into.<br /><br />Thankfully, I didn't have to worry too much, because Nsoft - the software development company which founded SPARK - offered me a summer internship! This was a great opportunity for me, and I learned a lot. In fact, I even got a job offer at the same company, which was quite a new experience to me.<br /><br />I was already a freshman in university at this point, so unfortunately I had to decline the job offer in favor of focusing on my studies.",

I figured that it was time to finally get some real work experience. During summer of that year, I accepted a job offer at Sportradar - Nsoft's parent company - as a junior backend developer.<br /><br />I plan on continuing my studies and getting a MSc in CS by 2027. After that, time can only tell - I might try out the academic route by getting a PhD, as recommended by a few of my professors. One thing I know for certain: my love for software development will never fade away.",
