In 2016, I signed up for a youth robotics tournament, in which my team and I won first place (...for 3 years in a row). After my success, I got really interested in programming. I enrolled in a prestigious coding academy for young people in my town soon after, although I was by far the youngest person to ever attend that course. I learned what programming is, and how to make my first website. It was the starting point of my career.",

During this time, I had to decide which area to specialize in: frontend, backend, mobile... It was hard to decide, so I naturally tried everything. Nowadays I consider myself a full stack developer, capable of making web, desktop, and mobile applications, as well as backend servers, CLI tools, and games in multiple languages. It wasn't easy, mind you. I was going to high school at the same time and I was also competing in multiple tournaments organized by my school (in which our team, of course, won multiple times in a row again).",

I was still very cautious when looking for jobs or education opportunities, because I was unsure what I was getting myself into. Thankfully, I didn't have to fret too much about that, because I got offered a summer internship! This was a great opportunity for me, and I learned a lot. In fact, I even got a job offer at the same company, which was quite a new experience to me. I was still looking to improve my knowledge and to get formally educated, so unfortunately I had to decline the job offer in favor of going to university. What follows after, I am yet to find out.",
